Cape Town – Quality assurance body, Umalusi, has given the 2022 National Senior Certificate (NSC) results the green-light, despite exams irregularities and problematic questions. Umalusi held a media briefing on Monday at its Umalusi House in Pretoria, where it gave the “go-ahead” announcement, indicating that some subject results had to be adjusted. A total of 1 222 652 candidates across four assessment bodies wrote the exams. The Independent Examinations Board (IEB) is expected to release private schools’ results on Wednesday, and the Department of Basic Education (DBE) on Thursday for public schools. Umalusi chief executive, Mafu Rakometsi, said the much talked about delays in the release of results was due to Covid-19  interruptions. According to the quality assurance body, irregularities identified during the writing and marking of the examinations were not systemic, therefore did not compromise the overall credibility and integrity of the exams. “Umalusi remains seriously concerned with reported cases of irregularities during the writing of the examinations. Different forms of cheating were uncovered in some centres during the examinations. “Based on the magnitude of the offences, different sanctions have been meted against the candidates involved such as the nullification of the results, barring the candidates from writing the examination for either 1 or 2 examination cycles,” said Rakometsi. Rakometsi also expressed concern about some of the questions that were found problematic in some subjects including History Paper 2 and English for IEB. The DBE had issues with Maths Paper 2 and Sepedi Home Language Paper 2. These problematic questions resulted in marking concessions being applied by the relevant assessment bodies for them to be excluded either entirely or partially from the question papers. Cape Times
