Cape Town – Two suspects are expected to appear in the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court for possession of stolen aluminium in Elsies River. Police spokesperson, Ndakhe Gwala, said the suspects were nabbed during a vehicle checkpoint operation in 11th Street, Elsies River, when police searched a truck that was transporting aluminium worth R38 000. The truck was accompanied by a sedan, and the driver of the sedan could not produce proof of ownership of the aluminium, and instead said the metal belonged to the company he worked for. The matter was then escalated, and the driver’s manager was shocked to learn that the items had been removed from the premises. “Targeted operations by the Economic Infrastructure Task Team resulted in three arrests on Saturday, 14 January 2023,” Gwala said. “The members of the task team conducted a vehicle checkpoint operation in 11th Street, Elsies River, searching for infrastructure related copper and implements. “They searched a truck that was transporting aluminium plates worth R38 000, accompanied by a sedan. “The driver of the sedan told the police officers that the aluminium plates belong to his company and they were bought by a scrapyard in Elsies River. “When he failed to produce proof of ownership, the matter was escalated to the trucking company where he is employed. “The manager was shocked to learn that the items had been removed from the premises. “Both suspects were arrested for possession of suspected stolen property. “They will appear in the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court.” Meanwhile, another suspect was arrested with aluminium and copper cables worth R2 100.
