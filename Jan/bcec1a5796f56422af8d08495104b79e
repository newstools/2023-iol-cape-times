Cape Town - The majority of deaths and road crashes recorded in the Western Cape over the festive season happened on municipal roads. Acting Mobility MEC, Ivan Meyer, on Monday unpacked the 2022/23 festive season provincial statistics at the Gene Louw Traffic College in Brackenfell. Of the 131 people who died on the roads, 68 were killed in 66 crashes on municipal roads, while 63 of the deaths took place in 52 crashes on provincial roads. Meyer said in December they received a boost of 85 personnel who graduated from the college. A total of 243 982 vehicles were stopped and checked, and 2 283 integrated law enforcement operations took place. Meyer aid arrests made included 446 for drunk driving, 98 for fraudulent documentation, 23 for speeding, and 52 for reckless and negligent driving.  Fourteen people were arrested for bribery, and four for possession of drugs. A total of 239 vehicles were impounded and 1 117 were discontinued in this period. “It’s bitter in the sense that someone did something knowing that they were doing something wrong but continuing nonetheless, and sweet because it is one more wrong-doer off our roads, I am especially proud of the number of arrests for bribery. This speaks to the ethics of provincial traffic,” said Meyer. Cape Times
