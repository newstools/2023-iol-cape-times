Cape Town - The NSPCA says it is investigating a possible dog hunting syndicate after 15 severely neglected greyhounds were found being transported for suspected dog hunting activities. The animal welfare organisation said it was contacted by the police, who found the dogs being transported in an overloaded vehicle. All 15 dogs were removed with the help of the local SPCA and taken to a vet to be examined and treated. “The veterinarian found that the dogs were severely neglected and in poor condition. One of the biggest concerns was that it was evident that none of the dogs received treatment for their chronic and underlying diseases, nor did they receive treatment for old and new injuries, which resulted in the injuries not healing properly. In addition to this, the dogs were also infested with internal and external parasites,” the NSPCA said. “There are a number of cruel elements that must be considered when it comes to illegally hunting with dogs. This includes the fact that the dogs are often cruelly trained to hunt and kill prey, they are found locked in filthy and small cages for the majority of their lives and only let out when they are trained or being used to hunt, they are underfed, when they are injured or sick they do not receive veterinary attention, and when they are no longer needed they are destroyed inhumanely. In addition to this, the prey animal that gets hunted often dies a painful death as they are mauled by the dogs and don’t die immediately.” Using dogs to hunt and kill other animals is illegal in South Africa. The NSPCA said it was working with the local SPCA, SAPS and the judiciary to ensure charges were pursued in terms of the Animals Protection Act no. 71 of 1962. Cape Times
