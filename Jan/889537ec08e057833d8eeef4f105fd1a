Cape Town - With children across the province headed back to school this week, the City of Cape Town has cautioned the public about the safety of scholar transport as more than 7 000 fines were issued for transgressions last year. In 2022, Cape Town traffic officers held 34 scholar transport operations at 52 schools around the metropole.  They issued 7 649 fines and impounded 116 vehicles. “Scholar transport is often overlooked until an incident captures the headlines. And yet, thousands of children are ferried to and from school on a daily basis by service providers – some more law-abiding than others.  “As we start this new academic year, I appeal to the drivers to do right by the many children whose lives they hold in their hands every day. To parents, I encourage you to do your due diligence and check the credentials of your chosen service provider, and even our schools – while not technically their responsibility, I do implore them to say something if they see something,” said safety and security mayco member JP Smith. According to the municipality, any person or company that offers a scholar transport service was required by law to have an operating permit, a public driving permit and a vehicle that was roadworthy, among others. These permits are obtained through the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works, and compliance is enforced by the City’s enforcement agencies. Among the challenges faced by enforcement staff, the City said, were that some operators overloaded their vehicles, and allowed unlicensed drivers behind the wheel. “Operators are reminded that, apart from being fined and having their vehicles impounded, they also risk having their operating licenses withdrawn or suspended if caught committing a transgression; they can be arrested for operating a service with fraudulent documentation; and that reckless and/or negligent driving too may result in arrest and the impoundment of their vehicle.” Cape Times
