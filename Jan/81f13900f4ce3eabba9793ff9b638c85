Cape Town - In his five years at Pinelands North Primary School, Siyabonga Lusaseni, 11, has touched many hearts with his positive disposition and excellent work ethic.  Among those he has impressed are his former teacher, Megan Culligan. Siya is a bright and lively Grade 6  pupil who comes from a loving family in Khayelitsha.  Culligan said: “I have had the privilege of seeing Siya grow and thrive in this environment. He is a beautiful little boy with a heart of gold. He loves school and learning, and has built many wonderful relationships with his teachers and peers over the years. He is full of energy, love and enjoys sports and being active.” Siya and his family are facing financial difficulties that are threatening to hinder his studies. Culligan has launched a crowdfunding campaign on BackaBuddy, appealing to the public to help Siya, so he may continue to flourish. She firmly believes that with a solid education, many doors can be opened for Siya. Since the launch of the campaign, more than R37 000 has been raised towards the target of R56 000, which will help cover Siya’s school fees, aftercare, tutoring, and the purchase of a tablet, which is required  from Grade 6. Culligan said any donation will go a long way toward securing Siya’s future growth.
