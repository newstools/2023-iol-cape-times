Cape Town - As 2022 came to an end, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA team had their hands full with various rescues, including a seal that was being harassed by beachgoers and their dogs at Bloubergstrand. With people flocking to various beaches around the Mother City, the CoGH SPCA Wildlife team was on standby for calls about wild animals in distress, the organisation said in a statement on Monday. The team rescued, among others, a Cape Fur seal in trouble at Bloubergstrand. The seal was tired and slightly underweight. “It is nothing out of the ordinary for seals to come to the shore to rest and regain their strength. Unfortunately, this seal was constantly being harassed, and the Cape of Good Hope SPCA was called in to come to the rescue,” the SPCA said. The organisation said the seal was not related to Santa the Seal which was rescued in Athlone recently. “Our Wildlife team immediately responded to assess the situation. Upon arrival, our Inspectors could see that the seal was very exhausted and needed some rest to recover. However, getting rest on this beach was out of the question,” the organisation said. Beachgoers wanted to take selfies with the seal and off-leash dogs were chasing it. “The safest option was for our team to capture the seal and take the seal to our Wildlife Department in Grassy Park to rest and regain his strength without any disturbances in our aqua ponds. “After a few days of rest and good food, the seal was ready to be released.” The team selected a quiet beach along Milnerton, and without hesitation, the seal left his carrier box and went into the sea.
