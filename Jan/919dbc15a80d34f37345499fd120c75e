Cape Town – A 60-year-old Canadian man has been hailed for jumping in to assist a bather in difficulty at Wilderness Beach. NSRI Wilderness station commander Mike Vonk said duty crews were activated following reports of a drowning in progress at about 5.30pm on Tuesday. “A man was swimming when he was caught in rip currents.” “A bystander Good Samaritan, from Canada, now living in South Africa, waded into the water to assist but was caught in the same rip current,” Vonk said. Robin Denault reached the bather who had slipped under water and he was able to hold the man’s head above water. “George Municipal lifeguards launched into the surf and reached them in the mid surf break. “NSRI Wilderness launched the NSRI rescue craft Rescue 23 Alpha and Ann Stratford Rescuer,” Vonk said. The man had by that stage reached the beach with four of the lifeguards while NSRI assisted one lifeguard back to shore. NSRI medics initiated medical treatment to the man, aged 24, from Gqeberha. “WC Government Health EMS rescue unit and ER24 ambulance services attended at the scene where the man was stabilised before being transported to hospital by ER24 ambulance in a serious but stable condition. He remained in hospital on Wednesday. “NSRI commend Good Samaritan Robin Denault for his effort that contributed to the man’s life being saved,” Vonk said. Cape Times
