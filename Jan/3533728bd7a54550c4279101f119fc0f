Cape Town – Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) teams assisted police to recover the body of a 58-year-old tourist from Table Mountain this week. Dedicated teams of professionals and volunteers from WSAR along with SAPS recovered the body of a fallen hiker on Wednesday. “A WSAR team numbering more than 20 personnel were transported to the top of Table Mountain with the assistance of the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway. “The team hiked across the top to an area near the Ledges route on Table Mountain’s eastern table,” WSAR said. Once on scene, members abseiled down to the fallen hiker and packaged him into a stretcher. Once secured, the team carefully raised the man’s body to the top of a cliff. The Western Cape Department of Health EMS / Air Mercy Service (AMS) rescue helicopter was tasked to assist with the recovery process and hoisted the stretcher up into the helicopter. The body was flown to a nearby landing zone and handed over to SAPS. WSAR spokesperson David Nel said: “We would like to thank all members involved in the operation and we extend our condolences to the family and friends of the deceased.” Outdoor lovers are urged to memorise the WSAR Emergency Number: 021 937 0300 and share the #IAmWildernessSafe campaign to help WSAR increase safety awareness.
