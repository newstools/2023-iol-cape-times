Cape Town - While road fatalities in the Western Cape have decreased compared to previous years, concern has been raised about motorists driving under the influence of alcohol. In the Provincial Traffic Services’ traffic operations report, the department confirmed that 11 fatalities were recorded in 10 crashes between January 3 - 8.  Acting Mobility MEC, David Meyer said while there was a reduction in many of the road safety statistics, he was still concerned with motorists driving under the influence of alcohol. The Safely Home theme for January is ‘Alcohol and Roads Don’t Mix’. In the last week, 36 motorists were arrested for driving under the influence and six pedestrians were killed in crashes. “While I am pleased with the reduction in arrests, I am still concerned that more than half of the arrests were for driving under the influence of alcohol, which has been a worrying theme this festive season,” said Meyer. Provincial Traffic Services carried out a total of 300 integrated roadblocks, vehicle check point and speed control operations across the Western Cape, and 37 977 vehicles were stopped and checked. A total of 12 670 fines were issued for various traffic violations ranging from driver to vehicle fitness. While 303 speeding offences were recorded, one motorist was clocked going 166 km/h in a 120 km/h zone. A total of 74 arrests were made for offences, including reckless and negligent driving, and possession of fraudulent documentation. “While the festive season is not yet over, all indications are that road fatalities are lower than they were a year ago. I wish to thank Provincial Traffic Law Enforcement and Road Safety Management, municipal traffic law enforcement services, the South African Police Service, and emergency services for all that they have done to keep road users safe over the holiday period,” said Meyer.
