Cape Town – Cooler weather conditions are aiding firefighting efforts in the mountains above Waverly Hills on the R46 between Ceres and Wolseley. About 75 firefighter crews, including ground teams, air support, pilots and seven vehicles, were deployed to assist in extinguishing a large blaze above the Waverley Hills farm. A stiff breeze had fuelled the blaze which resulted in concern as there are several structures situated close to the borders of the farm. The fire started on Tuesday afternoon. Cape Winelands District Municipality Municipality’s (CWDM) spokesperson Jo-Anne Otto said before sundown on Tuesday night, their fire service crews contacted ground teams from different organisations, including the CapeNature and Henley Air, and managed to drive the fire away from structures and crops. This prevented loss of property and livelihood. On Wednesday afternoon Otto said good progress was being made in containing the fire. “CWDM’s fire services, together with ground teams from NCC and CapeNature, as well as choppers Whiskey and Tango, continued with active fire fighting on the peak and in the gully above the Old Toll.  “The much cooler weather and good cloud cover, together with the aerial attack on the inaccessible areas, is reaping rewards in that the fire line has been much reduced.” Otto said fire teams were cautiously optimistic that due to favourable conditions, they will be able to contain the fire line later in the afternoon, after which monitoring and mopping-up activities would continue late into the night.
