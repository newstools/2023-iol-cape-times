Cape Town - In an exciting initiative, the Okapi Ladies International, a professional women’s-only race, will take place this weekend at the L’Ormarins King’s Plate in Kenilworth. About 14 female riders chosen from the twenty-odd applicants who come from varying equestrian backgrounds will showcase their ability down the 1 200m Hollywoodbets Kenilworth straight course this Saturday. Two international riders, O’Meara Rusike from Zimbabwe and Samantha Swanepoel of the UK, will be in attendance. Okapi founder Hanneli Rupert said they are excited to be sponsoring the Okapi Ladies International at the L’Ormarins King’s Plate and this will be the first of what they hope to be an ongoing addition to the race card. Riding master and former jockey Craig du Plooy said the candidates have all been outstanding. “They have joined my normal training classes for race riders and have been putting in the hard graft, showing lots of commitment. I want each rider to take the necessary precautions and make them as familiar as possible with all aspects of race riding. They have been doing track work, grass gallops and going through the starting stalls,” he said. Gina Goldsmith working with Jonathan Snaith were instrumental in making the special race happen. “Safety comes first, so all candidates are training rigorously on their strength and fitness. Thanks are also due to trainers around the country for supplying candidate horses for us to practise on. We hope it will add a bit of fun to L’Ormarins King’s Plate Day. A special mention to our sponsors Okapi and Cape Racing. Okapi is an African luxury lifestyle brand and is such a fitting partner for this historic event.” Cape Times
