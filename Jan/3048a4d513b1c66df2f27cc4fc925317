Cape Town - A pony called Dusty that was spotted to be in ill-health in Melkbosstrand after he had been walked for over 40 kilometres has been taken to a place of safety.  The Cape of Good Hope (CoGH) SPCA said they received a call on January 21 from the City’s Emergency Services, requesting assistance after Law Enforcement responded to a call from a member of the public who reported the pony in extremely poor condition, while it was being walked from Melkbosstrand past Morningstar on the N7 highway. “The City’s Law Enforcement officers apprehended the suspects on the N7 highway and waited for inspector Jeffrey Mfini to arrive.  “When Jeffrey arrived, he could immediately see that the pony was in no state to walk any further. The pony was severely underweight and had large wounds on his body. “The suspects alleged that they were waiting for the owner to deliver a horsebox, but that wasn’t the case, as the owner arrived in his vehicle with no horsebox. It appeared that the pony was going to be subjected to continue the torturous journey on foot in its dire state,” the SPCA said. The inspector decided that the best course of action would be to seize the pony and take him back to the CoGH SPCA Horse Care Unit in Grassy Park. “Dusty has been examined by our veterinarians and is receiving treatment for the wounds, and has been placed on a special diet to gain weight. The owner and his accomplices will now face criminal charges of animal cruelty in terms of the Animals Protection Act 71 of 1962,” the animal welfare organisation said. Currently, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA Horse Care Unit has 17 equines of different shapes and sizes in its care and is calling for help to continue its work. “Looking after horses does not come cheap. This week alone, we spent over R30 000 on food for our equine friends,” the SPCA said. To donate, visit https://capespca.co.za/donate/ Cape Times
