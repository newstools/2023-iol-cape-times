Cape Town - The Western Cape government is anticipates spending R88.8 million to procure backup generators to mitigate the impact of load shedding on local municipalities. Finance and Economic Opportunities MEC Mireille Wenger has authorised the release of the funds to be allocated to the department of local government for the procurement of back-up generators for the treatment and supply of water services. This is after the provincial cabinet held its first meeting of the year on January 25, when emergency funding needed to alleviate the consequences of unprecedented levels of power cuts was discussed as a short-term key priority. Strict conditions are expected to be attached to this expenditure, including that the amount must be reported to the Western Cape provincial parliament and auditor-general within 14 days. The allocations to municipalities must also be gazetted as per the requirements of the Division of Revenue Act, 2022. “This move represents the urgency that is desperately needed to address the knock-on effects of relentless power cuts on essential basic services. We cannot allow our citizens to suffer any further. We must act to urgently stabilise municipal services, such as water supply, wastewater treatment and sewerage infrastructure for our citizens,” said Premier Alan Winde. Wenger said the funding will also help mitigate the real risk of spillage of raw sewage into watercourses and interruptions of potable water supply, both of which have potential adverse health implications for citizens. “We face an emergency that requires an urgent response and emergency funding to protect our residents.” Cape Times
