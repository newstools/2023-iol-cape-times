Cape Town - The Cape of Good Hope (CoGH) SPCA with the help of the City of Cape Town’s Fire and Rescue service recently rescued a little pony from a stinky situation in Constantia. The CoGH SPCA said their teams had their hands full with various rescues in the last few days of 2022, including that of a pony named Spirit. “Spirit landed up in a septic tank after he broke through the fence surrounding the septic tank. “When Spirit walked over the cover on top of the septic tank, his weight was too heavy, and the cover broke. This left Spirit stranded inside the septic tank,” the SPCA said. Fortunately for Spirit, his owners found him in no time and called the the City of Cape Town’s Fire & Rescue for assistance. The City of Cape Town’s Fire & Rescue contacted the CoGH SPCA. “The brave men and women thought of a bright plan to get little Spirit out of the septic tank. The team placed bales of hay and sandbags into the tank to allow Spirit to use this as a step to get out of the tank.” The plan worked and Spirit was safely out of the septic tank. “Before the vet could examine Spirit, he had to be hosed down to get the smelly water off him. “The vet examined Spirit and fortunately, he was unharmed. Spirit’s owners will also be placing extra reinforcement around the septic tank to keep him from wandering where he shouldn’t,” the organisation said.
