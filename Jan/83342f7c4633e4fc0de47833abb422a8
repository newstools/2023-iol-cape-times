Cape Town - Yet another Cape Town beach has been closed due to sewage, this time affecting Gordon’s Bay. On Thursday, the City said that while the section of Fish Hoek Beach that was temporarily closed was reopened on Wednesday afternoon, as a precautionary measure the section of Gordon’s Bay beach between the walkway and the area in front of Spur has been temporarily closed. “The temporary closure is due to a sewer overflow in the area related to a sewer pump station that tripped because inappropriate materials had been thrown into the local sewer network yet again. “The pumps are being serviced and mitigation measures have been implemented in the meantime to maintain the sewer operations,” the City said. The City added that various City departments have been activated to respond to the incident and as a precaution, this section of the beach is closed until further notice. “City Health will be taking water samples on a daily basis for water quality testing until such time as the levels are within the minimum requirement for recreational activities as determined by the National Water Quality Guidelines. “In the meantime, the public is advised to avoid contact with the water until further notice. “This is a precaution as contact with the water could result in potential gastrointestinal issues and therefore any person who enters the water does so at their own risk.” Health warning signage has been erected. In recent weeks, beaches in Muizenberg, Bakoven, Fish Hoek, Strand and Small Bay in Blaauwberg have been closed briefly due to sewage-related issues. The City has said that sustained load shedding continues to affect City infrastructure, as does illegal dumping. Cape Times
