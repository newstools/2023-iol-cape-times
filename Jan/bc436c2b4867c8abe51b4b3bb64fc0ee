Cape Town - The matric class of 2022 has been urged to apply for the Western Cape’s Premier Advancement of Youth programme. The PAY programme is a 12-month internship that aims to give former matriculants the chance to obtain work experience with the Western Cape government. Applications opened on January 9 and will close on January 27. The programme provides matriculants between the ages of 17 and 24 with work experience and training at one of the 13 government departments. Last year, Premier Alan Winde disclosed that 485 young people, of whom more than 60% were women, participated in the PAY programme in 2022. MPP Christopher Fry encouraged 2022 matric learners from across the province to make use of this opportunity and apply for the programme. “(The programme) is especially beneficial to those who have not received study opportunities at higher learning institutions for the current academic year,” he said. The provincial Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport, through its youth and after-school project office, is also calling on unemployed youth to take up an opportunity for them to give a year of service to their communities. The programme, which is part of the national youth service initiative, provides young people with the opportunity to work with the support of a mentor to develop a number of key competencies needed in the workplace. “Our department wants to support our youth by offering these opportunities for them to get solid work experience,” said MEC Anroux Marais. The first applications close in mid-January, with the bulk closing in mid-February. For more information or to apply, visit: www.yearbeyond.org.
