Cape Town – Murder accused Jeremy Sias is expected to hear his fate at the Western Cape High Court on Thursday.  Judgment is expected to be handed down to Sias who, during trial, pleaded not guilty to the murder of Meghan Cremer. He, however, conceded through his legal counsel that he had disposed of Cremer’s body after he discovered her body in the boot of her vehicle. Sias has been charged with premeditated murder, aggravated robbery, theft, and obstruction of justice. He had been a general labourer on the Vaderlandsche Rietvlei Stables in Philippi, where Cremer rented and lived in a cottage, over a number of years. According to Sias’s version, he had picked up his friends in Cremer’s Toyota Auris and dropped them off at a shebeen.  He drove off and at some point before returning to the shebeen, he had discovered Cremer’s lifeless body in the boot of the car and disposed of the body before meeting again with his friends at the shebeen on the same night. A court indictment read: “On August 3, 2019, at approximately 5pm, (Sias) entered the cottage where (Cremer) lived. There Sias assaulted Cremer and strangled her.  “Sias then left with Cremer in the boot of her Toyota motor vehicle. Sias took various items stolen from Cremer, including her bank cards, cellphones, Ipad and handbag. “Sias left the premises and drove around looking for a place to dispose the body. Sias dumped Cremer’s body at Olieboom Road, Philippi Farms. Sias took the bank card of Cremer and made several automatic teller machine withdrawals, and presented the card at various points of sale between August 3 and 5, 2019.” The equestrian show jumper Cremer was reported missing after she hadn’t arrived at work. Days after her disappearance, she was found murdered with her hands bound and a restraint around her neck. Cremer was reported missing on August 3, 2019, and her body found at a sand mine along Olieboom Road, Cape Town, on August 8, 2019. Her vehicle had been found abandoned. Cape Times
