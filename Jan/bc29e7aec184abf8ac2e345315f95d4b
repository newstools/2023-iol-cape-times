Cape Town - A tracing operation is under way after an arrested taxi driver was helped by a group of amaphela owners who forced the release of the suspect in Hout Bay on Monday. This comes after Hout Bay SAPS and public order police were assisting in a joint operation between all the City’s enforcement agencies. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said metro police were swift in securing the area around the police station in efforts to find the suspect.   “This morning we rolled out extensive public transport enforcement operations, in response to the previous arson attack on a MyCiTi bus in the area. This was a joint operation between all the City’s enforcement agencies as well as Hout Bay SAPS and POPS. “With several taxis and amaphelas impounded, a group of amaphela owners gathered at the police station and using the advantage that most of SAPS resources were out with us in the area, forced the release of one of the arrested taxi drivers,” said Smith. Smith said the metro police and Taxi Enforcement Unit quickly arrived on scene and secured the area around the police station. “Tracing operations have commenced and additional charges of escaping from lawful custody will be brought against the offender,” said Smith. The joint operation was in response to a MyCiTi bus attack in Imizamo Yethu on January 11. The replacement cost of the 9m bus amounts to about R1.3 million. The arson and protest attacks were sparked by the City’s Traffic Services response to reports that minibus taxis were ranking illegally in the area and that some vehicles were operating without operating licences.
