Cape Town – The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has described travel restrictions imposed on Chinese citizens by some countries as a disappointing reinstatement of measures which have proven to be ineffective. This as the US and some countries in Europe will now require negative Covid tests from Chinese travellers who want to enter their countries. Covid numbers have risen rapidly in China as Beijing rolled back its “zero-Covid” lockdown regulations. “Several countries are introducing Covid-19 testing and other measures for travellers from China, even though the virus is already circulating widely within their borders,” Iata director-general Willie Walsh said. “It is extremely disappointing to see this knee-jerk reinstatement of measures that have proven ineffective over the last three years.” Walsh said research on the arrival of the Omicron variant concluded that putting barriers in the way of travel made no difference to the peak spread of infections. “At most, restrictions delayed that peak by a few days. If a new variant emerges in any part of the world, the same situation would be expected.” “Governments should listen to the advice of experts, including the WHO, that advise against travel restrictions. We have the tools to manage Covid-19 without resorting to ineffective measures that cut off international connectivity, damage economies and destroy jobs. Governments must base their decisions on ‘science facts’ rather than ‘science politics’.” According to reports, the South African Health Department will not be imposing travel restrictions or strict requirements on travellers from China, although it was monitoring the soaring Covid-19 cases in that country. Italy, whose population was hit hard by Covid-19 in 2020, was the first country to slap travellers from China with the testing requirement. Japan, India, South Korea and Taiwan have followed suit and now require tests for visitors coming from China. Cape Times
