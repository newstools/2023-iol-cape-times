Cape Town - After 24 days and a 3 300 nautical mile ocean crossing from Cape Town to Guanabara Bay, Brazil, the first complete crew from the Royal Cape Yacht Club Sailing Academy, hailing from marginalised communities, crossed the finish line of the 50th Cape2Rio yacht race. Described as a history-making voyage, skipper Sibusiso Sizatu, 30, first mate Daniel Agulhas, 29, Renaldo Tshepo Mohale, 29, Azile Arosi, 22, and Justin Peters, 21, battled neck and neck with their closest competitor, Argonaut, eventually beating them by 23 minutes in a thrilling battle to gain third position at the weekend. The crew departed on January 2. “This is the achievement of our lives,” said Sizatu. “So many years, so many obstacles, yet we kept moving forward. Thank you to my crew, the Royal Cape Yacht Club Academy, our sponsor Alexforbes and our supporters. “When we were down at sea, your support drove us. This one is for you.  “Crossing the meridian was a moment we won’t forget, as well as the last 16 hours, where we were all hands on deck racing for a podium position.” Viresh Maharaj, Alexforbes executive, said the team made the country proud. “Sibu and his crew are an example to all of us that with the right support, determination and grit, dreams can and do come true. “Congratulations to our five heroes – you overcame your personal circumstances and defied society’s expectations by going boldly into this race. Nenze kakuhle (well done).” For more on the yacht race, visit www.cape2rio.live Cape Times
