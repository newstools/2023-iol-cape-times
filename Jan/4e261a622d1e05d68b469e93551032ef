Cape Town - The discovery of a porcupine carcass that washed up on Melkbosstrand Beach has sparked concern among animal-welfare organisations.  It comes just a few days after an aardvark washed up on Sunset Beach.  In another similar incident, images were shared last week of a dead tortoise, seemingly with a rope tied through a hole in its shell, that washed up at Eden on the Bay.  It is suspected that the incidents are related to the illegal trade in African animals.  Cape of Good Hope SPCA spokesperson, Marisol Gutierrez, said they were waiting for a post mortem of the porcupine.  “We were handed the porcupine carcass and are awaiting the results of a post mortem, after which we'll be in a better position to comment further.” Animal Welfare Society spokesperson, Allen Perrins, said the incidents were of concern.  “The recent spate of dead wild animals found along the West Coast smacks of something very sinister and adds credence to the suspicion that they may have been dumped at sea by illicit wildlife traders. What other rational explanation can there be for these unusual finds? This is not their natural habitat and there appears to be an insatiable demand for many of our indigenous animals. There are people allegedly willing to pay handsomely for rare and endangered species,“ he said.  The SPCA has appealed to anyone with any leads and information relating to animals who have washed up on the coastline to contact them.  The SPCA Inspectorate can be contacted on  on 021 700 4158/9.
