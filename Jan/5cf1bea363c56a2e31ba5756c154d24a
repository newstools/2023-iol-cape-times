Cape Town - Two people were treated for bite wounds after they were attacked by a seal pup while swimming at Clifton's fourth beach on Tuesday. The City of Cape Town, NSRI and Cape of Good Hope SPCA have since urged beachgoers to keep a distance from marine and coastal wildlife after a video of the incident was widely shared on social media. The NSRI said reports indicate similar incidents involving aggressive seals in Hout Bay and Yzerfontein and in recent months at Fish Hoek beach and at Noordhoek. “We are appealing to bathers and paddlers to stay clear of seals and avoid marine animals in their environment,” the NSRI said. The Cape Good Hope SPCA said they are investigating to ascertain possible reasons for the seal’s unusual behaviour. “Although the SPCA did visit the scene of the incident, the child and woman who were attacked by the seal had left by the time the SPCA Inspectors arrived,” it said. The Department of Environmental Affairs and marine scientists are also investigating. Kim Krynauw of the Hout Bay Seal Rescue Centre said they were at the scene. “When we arrived the incident had not happened yet. The animal went into the ocean and this is when the chaos happened, with people shouting and screaming, the poor animal was so traumatised it was biting people and going crazy. People were beating it and kicking it. “We were then asked to stand down by the COCT and not remove the animal in front of people after the incident, as it might be upsetting,” she said. Mayco member for Spatial Planning and Environment, Eddie Andrews said the city is aware of the video being shared on social media. “Residents are reminded to keep their distance from marine mammals and to not interfere with them. Residents and visitors are encouraged to treat all marine and coastal wildlife with respect and to remove their pets from areas where wildlife may be present,” he said. Cape Times
