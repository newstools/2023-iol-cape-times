Provincial Transport and Public Works spokesperson, Jandre Bakker, said in the single crash vehicle, there were 11 people. “Two adults and a baby boy were killed and five people from the eight who survived were seriously injured.  “According to the passengers in the vehicle the driver lost control of the vehicle which caused the vehicle to roll.  “All role players including EMS, fire and rescue attended the scene,” said Bakker. Hours later, on Sunday morning, another single vehicle crash incident was reported, wherein a passenger of a vehicle was killed and the driver injured. The vehicle was travelling towards the direction of Leeu Gamka to Beaufort West. The cause of the crash was still being investigated. “This is disheartening to the department after a successful festive season and we plead to motorists to always abide by the rules of the road. Never speed and always buckle up, never overload or drink and drive. We also urge passengers to never distract a driver,” said Bakker. The incidents at the weekend came as the acting provincial MEC for Mobility, Ivan Meyer, was expected to present the festive season 2022/23 road safety report on Monday. Last week Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula released the national 2022-'23 road safety report, where 1 451 people died on the roads - a 13.9% reduction compared to the 1 685 deaths recorded during the previous festive season. The Western Cape saw a decline from 207 the previous year to 131. Cape Times
