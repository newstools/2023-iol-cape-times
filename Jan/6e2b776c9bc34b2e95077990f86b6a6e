Concerted efforts underway to combat the scourge of copper and cable theft in Drakenstein Municipality. Cape Town - The Drakenstein Municipality has lauded the efforts of SAPS following the arrest of a suspect and confiscation of R400 000 worth of stripped copper. Mayor Conrad Poole congratulated police for the arrest made last week. The suspect, who cannot yet be named, is from Chicago in Paarl East and is in his late fifties. He is expected to make a court appearance. “The Municipality is serious about fighting the scourge of cable and copper theft. We urge our residents to report any suspicious activity relating to cable theft to our 24/7 control room at 021 807 8508, or to the police,” Poole said.  Responding to a tip-off, Paarl East Police reportedly raided three homes in Chicago and made the shocking discovery of several buckets filled with stripped copper cable. According to Poole, the suspect could reportedly not provide a reasonable explanation for being found in possession of the copper and was arrested. Police spokesperson, Ndakhe Gwala, said: “Paarl East Police recovered copper cables worth R400 000 in Chicago, Paarl East during a raid on Wednesday, January 4. The station received a tip-off and assembled a team of crime prevention unit members, sector managers and new recruits to follow up on the information. They subsequently raided three houses in Chicago, when at the third house, a bucket filled with stripped copper wire was found. The police arrested a man in his early fifties on the scene and the copper was confiscated. “Once charged, the suspect will appear in the Paarl Magistrate’s court,” said Gwala. Poole said the combined efforts by the police, the Municipality's Cable Theft Unit, community policing forums and other Drakenstein Smart Safety Network (DSSN) partners to combat cable theft are paying off.
