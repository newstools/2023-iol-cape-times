Cape Town – With the help of the highly-trained K9 unit, Metro Police this week discovered drugs hidden inside a brick wall in a Hanover Park home. Metro Police received info of drug dealing at a premises in Turflynn Road, Hanover Park on Wednesday. With the occupants believing they had time to securely stash their contraband, permission for a search was granted, City mayco member for safety and security, JP Smith said. “Metro Police K9 member Kalisi was adamant of the presence of narcotics in what appeared to be a conventional brick wall. Trusting in the abilities of the K9 member and on closer inspection, the wall was opened and in the cavity a consignment of drugs was discovered.  “Such results continue to demonstrate the incredible value of a working, efficient K9 unit. In the interest of literally leaving no stone unturned, and in acknowledging the fact that national government has crippled the existing SAPS K9 Unit, the CCT has already undertaken to massively expand its existing Metro Police K9 unit.” Smith said with an expanded K9 unit, these valuable colleagues would be used to further assist additional LEAP teams and local SAPS members as they implement their crime prevention initiatives.
