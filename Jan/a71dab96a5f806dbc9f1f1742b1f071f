Cape Town - The NSPCA says authorities recently took a decision to euthanize a number of giant land snails found to have been illegally brought into South Africa from Nigeria. The organisation said their Special Projects Unit was contacted last week to assist with a consignment of 47 giant land snails illegally brought into the country. “Officials from OR Tambo International airport found the snails in a state of ‘hibernation’ inside a wooden box, and when they found that the animals were brought into the country without the relevant permits and documentation, they contacted the environmental authorities,” the NSPCA said. “The animals were taken to the Kempton Park SPCA where the authorities requested that the snails be euthanized as required in terms of legislation regarding invasive species.” The organisation added that the guilty parties involved in attempting to smuggle the snails did not have the welfare and well-being of these animals at heart. “Over and above the manner in which these animals were transported, and the concerns regarding bringing an invasive species into the country, had the perpetrators not been caught, the snails may have suffered an even worse fate as they were most likely destined for consumption.” The NSPCA said their Special Projects Unit regularly conducts inspections at OR Tambo International Airport to ensure that the welfare of animals in transit is not compromised, and to take action in cases where animals have been subjected to suffering. “The NSPCA extends its sincere appreciation to the Kempton Park SPCA for their assistance with this case.” Cape Times
