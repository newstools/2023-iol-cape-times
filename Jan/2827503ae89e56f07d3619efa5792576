Cape Town - The NSPCA says it is considering taking legal action against the owner of Sheba the Bengal tigress that was shot dead after he allegedly failed to capture her safely. Sheba was darted and killed on Wednesday after she managed to escape from her enclosure in Walkerville, Johannesburg, last Friday. The NSCPA on Thursday noted that it was not the first case of a wild animal escaping captivity. “Contrary to some reports, the tigress was not captured and then euthanised. “The owner failed to capture her safely and ultimately she was shot and killed after entering a populated dwelling in the area. “The NSPCA and the local SPCA (Vereeniging and Vanderbijlpark) were not contacted and did not form part of the decision to shoot and kill the animal. “This is not the first case of a wild animal escaping captivity, nor is it the first time that the animal is made to pay the price for irresponsibility and lack of compassion. “The NSPCA is currently investigating the matter further, taking various angles into account, and is giving serious consideration to taking legal action against the owner of the tigress for the events that have unfolded,” the NSPCA said. It further said that with basic legislation and no inspections by authorities, it had become far too easy for people to own and breed exotic wild animals. “In Gauteng, permits are not required to keep exotic wildlife. The only permit currently required is an import permit. “It is evident that the basic legislation is written for the convenience of people who wish to exploit these animals. “The welfare of the animal is certainly not taken into consideration, and the safety of the community is disregarded as well. If the welfare of the animals and the people were taken into account, these animals would not be kept in captivity, and the community would be protected from the dangers of an escaped wild animal,” it said.
