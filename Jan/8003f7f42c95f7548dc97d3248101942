Cape Town – Provincial police recently thwarted the trafficking of 30 bags of mandrax tablets with a street value of about R1.5 million in Beaufort West. It was an alleged attempted act of bribery by the man allegedly transporting the drugs that led to a search of his car and discovery of the illicit substance. According to Southern Cape police spokesperson Christopher Spies, members attached to the provincial organised crime investigation narcotics section were busy with routine vehicle checks along the N1 at about 9.30am on Friday. They spotted a silver Toyota Corolla parked at a petrol filling station with the driver acting suspiciously when he noticed the officers. The officers proceeded to approach the driver who then allegedly offered to pay them R400 to escort him past traffic officials patrolling the highway. “The vigilant members arrested the suspect on a bribery charge and proceeded with a search of his vehicle and found 30 000 mandrax tablets in bags concealed in the boot and panels of the vehicle. Police confiscated the find and seized the vehicle. The suspect remains in police custody,” Spies said. The suspect is expected to make his first court appearance in the Beaufort West magistrate's court on Monday facing charges of dealing in drugs and bribery. Provincial Commissioner Thembisile Patekile praised the officers involved. “Police will continue to deploy more boots on the ground to rid communities of drugs which poses a threat to the safety of our rural and vulnerable communities. While we commemorate National Police Day, our members should at all times maintain a high standard of service delivery and endurance, whilst also taking care of their safety and wellbeing.” Cape Times
