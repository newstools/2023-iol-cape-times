Cape Town - With the countdown to the release of the final matric results next week, the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) will host a live question-and-answer session for anxious parents and pupils. “Ask the Expert” chat will take place on Friday at 1pm.

Ask real-time questions online for our experts to answer. Don’t miss out,” Sadag said. The matric exams came to an end on December 8. Over 3 300 matric paper markers in the Western Cape marked 870 000 scripts.
