Cape Town - South Africa’s Ndavi Nokeri is one of the front-runners at this year’s Miss Universe pageant according to social media polls and predictions. Online sites including Philstar.com, Missology and Miss Universe Predictions have the reigning South African queen as one of the front-runners, alongside favourites including Venezuela’s Amanda Dudamel, the Philippines’ Celeste Cortesi and Puerto Rico’s Ashley Cariño. The Miss Universe finale takes place on Sunday, January 14, at the New Orleans Morial Convention Centre in Louisiana in the US, where Harnaaz Sandhu of India will crown her successor. Contestants from 84 countries are competing in the pageant which will be hosted by Jeannie Mai and Miss Universe 2012, Olivia Culpo. Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray and entertainment reporter Zuri Hall will serve as backstage correspondents. This marks the first time in the pageant’s 70-year history that there has been an all-women presenting panel. Nokeri arrived in New Orleans last week after spending an exciting few days in New York. “It has been wonderful meeting my fellow contestants face-to-face and getting to know them. My preparations are on track and I’m working hard. Zozi (Tunzi) has given me advice that I have taken to heart – to be confident and to be my authentic self. “I also appreciate the wonderful support from all South Africans. I will be flying the flag high when I walk onto the Miss Universe stage and I am determined to give it my all, just as I did when I entered the Miss South Africa pageant,” Nokeri said. The event will be broadcast live on 1 Magic (DStv Channel 103) from 3am on Monday, January 15 and repeated in a prime time slot, details of which are still to be announced. Cape Times
