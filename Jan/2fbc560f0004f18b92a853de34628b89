Cape Town - Following a tip-off, metro police were able to nab three suspects in connection with property stolen from a Gift of the Givers warehouse over the weekend, bringing the total number of suspects apprehended to ten. The City of Cape Town on Wednesday said its Metro Police Specialised teams made three arrests following a tip off on Monday, and recovered some of the stolen property including relief packs for fire victims. The suspects were handed over at Philippi SAPS along with the recovered goods. “Metro Police officers played a role in the multi-agency joint operation together with SAPS and other roleplayers which led to 10 arrests in total, three of which were made by our officers. Information was gained of the stolen Gift of the Givers property being stored at four different warehouses in Hanover Park. Arrests were made for ‘possession of stolen goods’,” safety and security mayco member JP Smith said. “Further investigation by SAPS will be needed to ensure all those responsible face the full might of the law.” The successful arrests and recovery of goods stolen from Gift of the Givers shows what is possible when all authorities join forces to fight crime, Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis added. The humanitarian organisation has since said it was in awe of the support and messages of goodwill and prayers received after their Athlone office was burgled early on Monday.  Cape Times
