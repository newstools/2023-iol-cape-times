Cape Town - A paraglider has been hospitalised after crash landing on Lion’s Head. Emergency services were called to the scene around 2pm on Tuesday where a man believed to be in forties, was found wedged between two large rocks, being tended to by bystanders. City of Cape Town mayco member for Safety and Security JP Smith added that various teams had responded to a distress call of a paraglider accident over Bantry Bay Tuesday afternoon. “A paraglider had run into difficulties and had crashed into the slopes of Lions Head. Found in a critical condition, the victim was airlifted for an emergency medical response.” ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring added that they were called to the scene shortly after 2pm. “Medics assessed the man and found that he had sustained severe injuries to his head and was in critical condition. The man was treated and provided with advanced life support interventions before he was airlifted by the AMS Medical Helicopter to Groote Schuur Hospital for urgent care.  “The exact details surrounding this incident are unknown,” Meiring said. Smith said years ago, he had enjoyed the sport and was familiar with the associated risks and extensive training required.  “While I had to retire from the sport since I was no longer able to find enough time for the regular flights required to retain one's license, I often miss the paragliding and wish the patient well in his recovery.”  Cape Times
