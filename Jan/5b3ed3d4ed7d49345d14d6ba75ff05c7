Cape Town - The Western Cape’s Law Enforcement Advancement Plan (LEAP) officers arrested 100 suspects for firearms-related offences during December. The arrests were part of 747 arrests for an array of offences. The arrests included: “I would like to thank the LEAP officers for their continued hard work in the various areas where they are deployed,” said Police Oversight and Community Safety MEC Reagen Allen. “The manner in which these officers go about their work is truly inspiring. It fills me with joy to see how passionate they are to create safer communities, so that our residents can live in dignity. “This is part of the reason why we launched the Western Cape Safety Plan. With LEAP stemming from the safety plan, we want the residents to know that their safety and wellbeing is our priority,” he said. During the same period, LEAP officers searched 36 976 people; searched 1 377 houses; conducted 6 202 patrols in hotspot areas; conducted 356 roadblocks and searched 3 883 vehicles. “LEAP is not an island, and these successes are not achieved by them alone. They work closely with other City of Cape Town law enforcement agencies, SAPS, neighbourhood watches and Community Police Forums (CPF). I once again urge communities to work with and support all law enforcement agencies, as through this cooperation, we will become more effective in our fight against crime,” Allen said. Cape Times
