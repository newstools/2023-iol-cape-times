Cape Town - Edgemead Neighbourhood Watch is appealing to residents to report any suspicious activity following a spate of smash-and-grab incidents in the area.  The group says they have received at least five reports of smash-and-grab incidents that have taken place on the Bosmansdam/N7 bridge over the past few weeks.  Residents are urged always to be conscious of their surroundings and remain alert.  “Lock all your doors and close the windows when driving. Always be conscious of your surroundings and remain alert when coming to an intersection or stopping your vehicle.  “Constantly be on the lookout for suspicious-looking characters. Be wary of people standing aimlessly at the intersection.  “When driving late at night towards this intersection, slow down well in advance so that the light changes to green by the time you reach the intersection,” the group said.  Residents have also been urged to remove items from their cars.  “Reduce the chances of becoming a target by removing items that criminals are trying to get their hands on. Even a shopping bag is enough to attract a criminal to attempt to smash your window. “If you find yourself becoming a victim, drive to your nearest police station and report it immediately. Even if nothing was taken, if the SAPS are not aware (of the incident), then they cannot be proactive (and) patrol the area and possibly prevent this from happening again.“ Bothasig SAPS can be contacted at 021 559-9400 or 10111.
