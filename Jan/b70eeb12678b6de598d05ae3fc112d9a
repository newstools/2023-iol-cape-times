Cape Town - Metrorail says final inspections are being conducted to prepare for the reintroduction of the train service along the Northern Line. Metrorail on Wednesday posted a picture on social media of a test train at Eerste River station. Representatives from customer services, marketing and communications, business risk, among other officials, conducted a station visit on the Northern Line. Metrorail Western Cape acting spokesperson, Zino Mihi said: “We are currently conducting final inspections in conjunction with the Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) to ensure that all is in order in preparation for the re-introduction. “As soon as we are ready, we will communicate.” In December, Metrorail had suspended the long-awaited reintroduction of train services between Eerste River and Bellville along the northern corridor. The line has been non-operational since March 2020, and it was anticipated to be reopened in December. However, Metrorail said the service had to be again temporarily suspended due to “environmental issues” that were affecting the line’s operation. Mihi said at the time: “The Permanent Way Department of our Infrastructure team was hard at work improving a rail track condition that developed from last week’s heavy rains (poor drainage) between Bellville and Eerste River.” She said the technical team was busy with this and an announcement would be made once the problem was resolved.
