Cape Town - The City of Cape Town’s Urban Mobility Directorate is investigating the cause of a fire that broke out on a MyCiTi N2 Express bus travelling along the N2 inbound lane close to Bhunga Avenue on Monday morning. No injuries were reported. The City said it was informed at about 7.48am that an N2 Express bus was on fire close to Bhunga Avenue. The City’s Fire Services assisted with extinguishing the fire, and the bus driver and about 60 passengers disembarked unharmed. The bus was on its way from Mitchells Plain towards the Civic Centre station in the Cape Town central business district when passengers alerted the bus driver about smoke at the rear end of the bus. The bus driver pulled over and all evacuated the vehicle safely. A replacement bus transported the passengers to the Civic Centre station. “We will investigate the cause of the fire with assistance from the vehicle operating company, independent assessors, insurers, and the vehicle manufacturer. Thus, more details will only be available once the assessments have been completed. I’m extremely grateful that nobody was injured during this incident. I want to thank the passengers and the bus driver for staying calm and responsive, and express my appreciation to the SAPS and the City’s firefighters for their prompt assistance,” said the City’s mayoral committee member for urban mobility, councillor Rob Quintas.
