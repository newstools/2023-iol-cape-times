Traditional cleaning products that can be found on the shelves at your local retailer can be expensive, and they are harsh on the environment too. SweepStars – the domestic workers who work for SweepSouth – offer natural, simple ways to clean. Their tips are quick, effective and, most importantly, use all-natural products that are found in most kitchen cupboards. Here are some ideas to try: – If your microwave has old food splatters, you can get rid of them by placing a bowl filled with one-third vinegar and two-thirds water inside it. Heat this for five minutes until the microwave is steamed up. The food splatters will now be soft enough to remove with a wet cloth. If these stains don’t come off, then repeat the process. – Does your bathroom shower have black mould or mildew? To remove the stains, make a paste of one part vinegar and two parts bicarbonate of soda. Apply directly onto the mould, allow to dry, then scrub away with an old toothbrush and rinse. – The trick to getting rid of smelly drains is to mix half a cup of bicarbonate of soda with a quarter cup of salt. Sprinkle the mixture down the drain, followed by a cup of warm white vinegar. After letting it sit for 10 minutes, pour hot water down the drain. – Do you have stains at the bottom of your pots or pans? Put half a lemon, bicarbonate of soda, and vinegar in the pot or pan and bring it to a boil. Then empty out the mixture, and wipe the item down with a cloth. IOL Business
