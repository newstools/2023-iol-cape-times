Cape Town - Police have arrested two men, believed to be Langa safety patrollers, in connection with the murder of an alleged robber last week. Police said they were alerted to a person who was assaulted and later died in hospital due to injuries sustained on January 3. Police spokesperson Frederick Van Wyk said two suspects, aged 32 and 34, were arrested on Tuesday and charged in connection with a murder case. “They will appear in Bishop Lavis Magistrate Court Wednesday, on the mentioned charges,” Van Wyk said. “The Police sensitised the community members not to take the law into their own hands because they will be prosecuted.” The patrol group declined to comment on Tuesday, saying the matter was now in court. Langa Saps Station Commander Colonel Ronald Jacobs appealed to any community members who may have been assaulted by the patrollers to come forward and report those cases. Langa councillor Lwazi Phakade said they were very shocked by the incident. “The office was made aware of this unfortunate incident this morning. The office is very shocked by this incident and we have since contacted the family to offer support to them. “We do not have full details of the incident from the police but will be in contact with them to understand the facts and how far the investigation is,” Phakade said. Anyone with information on the incident can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 0860010111, or SMS Crime Line on 32211. Cape Times
