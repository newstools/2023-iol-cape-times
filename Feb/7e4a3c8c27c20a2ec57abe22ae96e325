Cape Town - The bereaved family of Mossel Bay mother Kirsty James, who was stabbed multiple times allegedly by a close friend and colleague, say they hope justice will be done as the matter is back in court next month. James was allegedly attacked by Fallon Edwards at her office in October last year. The 32-year-old is reported to have sustained 64 stab wounds all over her body in the brutal attack and succumbed to her injuries on the way to hospital. She leaves behind her two-year-old daughter. It is alleged the gruesome murder follows after James reported a case of fraud involving Edwards. The accused woman, aged 32, appeared briefly in the Mossel Bay Magistrate’s Court in November last year. The case was postponed until March 1 for further investigation. Edwards, who remains in custody, is believed to be a close friend of James and her family. James’ mother, Marion Bruinders said they were still struggling to cope after her death. “We are struggling to cope, especially my brothers and sister. I am currently booked in at (a clinic). My psychologist advised I do that. It has been a very difficult time. It's as if reality has kicked in now. I am in a emotional state,” she said. Bruinders said they hope justice will be served. “I don't want revenge, I was not raised that way. I want justice to make that decision. I miss my daughter a lot. My grandchild will be raised without a mother now,” she said. Community activist Faizel Porter described James as a peaceful and loving person. “I don’t think that Kirsty being the person that she is deserved to have her life ended like this. They were close friends and colleagues. It is alleged that the accused colleague was not at work on that day, and she came to the office with intent and that is how she then assaulted and stabbed Kirsty to death. No person deserves to die in such a way,” Porter said. Cape Times
