Cape Town – City of Cape Town teams are on standby to assist residents to update their prepaid electricity meters ahead of the software’s expiration date in 2024. The software for all prepaid electricity meters must be updated or customers won’t be able to recharge their meters with new tokens; and will be left without power supply. The City said it is following a phased approach and area by area is being earmarked for updating. Customers in a specific area will receive two update codes with their purchase when their time comes for the update. If the City has not reached an area, and customers have not received the update codes with their electricity purchase, they are not yet due for the update. “Eligible customers will notice they are due for the update when they make a purchase and see the update codes. City teams will be on standby in these areas in February 2023 to assist customers if required,” the City said. So far, more than 38 areas in the metro have already been reached in the prepaid electricity meter software upgrade programme and around 300 000 prepaid meters have been updated. Residents in the following areas are able to update their electricity meters as of 1 January to 28 February 2023: ·       Rondebosch ·       Newlands ·       Camps Bay ·       Cape Town ·       Green Point ·       Sea Point ·       Signal Hill/Table Mountain ·       Observatory ·       Paarden Eiland ·       Hanover Park Customers can follow three steps to enter the update codes when their area is scheduled for the update: 1.
