Cape Town - A Table Bay Harbour police constable, the fourth suspect arrested in connection with a kidnapping case, is expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court together with his co-accused on Thursday. Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani said the 27-year-old suspect was arrested on Wednesday in a multidisciplinary operation involving the Provincial Kidnapping Task Team of the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation, Provincial Organised Crime, Crime Intelligence and Forensic Science Laboratory teams. This comes after the arrest of his co-accused, Luvuyo Lwabi, 33, Nicodimus Pasapanodya, 32, and Andrew Seko, 25, on January 24. The trio appeared in court on January 25 and were remanded in custody. “It is alleged that on January 22, two victims were taken from their home on Empress Tree Street in Thubelitsha, Cape Town, by four men and held hostage in a house on Crescent Road, Philippi East. “It is also reported that the suspects made off with the victims’ vehicle, a blue Ford Ranger bakkie which was later recovered at an informal settlement near Faure Drive.” Hani said. “The matter was reported to the Hawks for further probing, which led to the arrest of the accused and the safe release of the victims, who were immediately taken to hospital for treatment after they were badly tortured by the suspects.” Two vehicles suspected to be used in the commission of crime were seized. The constable and his co-accused are facing charges of kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Cape Times
