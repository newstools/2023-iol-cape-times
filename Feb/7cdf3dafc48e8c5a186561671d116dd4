Cape Town – Tourism Sentiment Index (TSI), a travel data intelligence solution created by destination marketing agency Destination Think, has released its “Leading Places: The 100 Most Loved Destinations Around the World” for 2023. Coming in at #18 was Hermanus, after being seeded #41 last year, with Stellenbosch ranking at #34, and Cape Town moving up 14 places to #40. Hermanus’ “top asset” was listed as wildlife viewing, Stellenbosch’s “top asset” was winery and vineyards and Cape Town’s “top asset” was restaurants and dining. Maldives was ranked the “Most Loved Destination” in the world, followed closely by the Whitsundays and the Sunshine Coast respectively, both in Queensland, Australia. Welcoming the announcement, Finance and Economic Opportunities MEC Mireille Wenger, said: “To have not one, but three of our stunning towns in the top 50 of the ‘100 Most Loved Destinations in the World’ is an outstanding accolade for the Western Cape. Congratulations to Cape Town, Stellenbosch and Hermanus for being recognised, rightly so. “I am hopeful that the exposure generated by this recognition will attract even more visitors to our shores to explore more of our many and diverse towns, attractions, and offerings in the Western Cape. The Western Cape government will continue to collaborate with stakeholders across the tourism and hospitality sector to reach new heights and attract more tourists so we can boost economic growth, and that will create jobs in the province.” Uncovering the 100 most loved destinations around the globe according to consumer sentiment, the study tracked more than 1.6 billion online conversations and content pieces publicly available and about 21 330 global destinations to identify the top 100 most loved destinations around the globe.
