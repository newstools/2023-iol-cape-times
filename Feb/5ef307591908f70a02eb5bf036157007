Cape Town – A 54-year-old hiker was rescued from a cliff-top ledge high above Camps Bay at the weekend.  Wilderness Search And Rescue (WSAR) said the woman’s location was confined and very exposed, with a 10m cliff below. “Dedicated teams of professionals and volunteers from WSAR were called to assist the 54-year-old woman on Saturday morning from Cairn Ravine, the first ravine after the Kloof Buttress, on the Camps Bay side of Table Mountain.  “The hiking group had been scrambling up a steep section of the route, when a member miss-stepped and fell 5 metres backwards, landing on the broken ground below,” the search and rescue organisation said. “Fortunately, her backpack offered some protection, but her shoulder was injured, and she was unable to proceed.”  A WSAR team on board an Western Cape Department of Health EMS/Air Mercy Service (AMS) rescue helicopter was immediately dispatched to the scene.  Once in position, a rescue climber and paramedic were hoisted down to the patient. “The rescue climber immediately constructed a rope safety point, to ensure that the team members and the patient were protected from falling from the ledge.  “The patient was packaged into a stretcher and hoisted up into the helicopter, before being flown to a nearby landing zone and handed over to a waiting ambulance.  “She was driven to hospital.” In case of emergency, contact the WSAR on: 021 937 0300 WSAR’s David Nel said when reporting any emergency, it’s essential that callers provide clear, appropriate information.  “Speak clearly and don’t rush the information you’re trying to get across.  “This allows the control centre staff to dispatch the appropriate responses quickly, saving valuable time.  “We wish our patients a full recovery and we thank all WSAR members for their continued commitment.” Cape Times
