Cape Town – Suspended ANC MPL, Andile Lili, is expected to go on trial next month for the alleged assault of the female principal of Inkanini Primary School in Khayelitsha.  Lili’s assault case on Wednesday was postponed to March 7 for trial. This, while his legal team prepares to argue in mitigation of sentence in a different criminal matter later this week. Lili is accused of assaulting the principal at the Khayelitsha School on November 21 last year. Earlier this week, Lili was suspended from the party after being referred to the Provincial Parliament’s Conduct Committee relating to criminal charges he faces. He was suspended with immediate effect. ANC provincial spokesperson, Sifiso Mtsweni, confirmed Lili’s suspension. “The interim provincial committee (IPC) has invoked the step-aside guidelines to Lili for him to attend to his court case. He will remain on step aside as a member of the ANC IPC.  “We are engaging the ANC caucus on further steps as it relates to his role in the legislature. We will follow proceedings as it relates to the conduct committee’s work on this matter,” said Mtsweni. Enquiries to Lili’s legal team weren’t answered by deadline. Lili is also facing sentencing after he was convicted in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on two counts of attending illegal gatherings outside the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on August 12, 2014 and July 28, 2015 and inciting members of Ses’khona People’s Movement to kill. His legal team will be filing heads of arguments by February 10 for the illegal gatherings matter. Cape Times
