Cape Town – South Africa has recorded a third cholera case. National Health Department spokesperson Foster Mohale said the patient is the husband of one of the first two cases announced by Health Minister Dr Joe Phaahla earlier this week. “(The patient) was admitted to hospital on Saturday after he exhibited symptoms of cholera, and his test results came back positive yesterday. “This is the first secondary transmitted case,” Mohale said on Wednesday. Phaahla said on Sunday that the country had recorded two confirmed cases of cholera imported from Malawi. The patients were sisters who had travelled together from Johannesburg to Malawi to attend a funeral service, and returned by bus on January 30. Both patients had developed symptoms on their return to Johannesburg. One patient presented to a local clinic and was then admitted to hospital. During the case investigation and follow-up of close contacts, the sister reported that she had also developed diarrhoea while travelling back from Malawi but it resolved within a day and she did not seek health care. The department has reminded the public about key cholera symptoms of diarrhoea and dehydration, together with the importance of always washing one’s hands with soap and water/sanitiser after using the bathroom/toilet and before preparing and eating food. Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, and outbreaks usually occur in settings with inadequate sanitation and insufficient access to safe drinking water. Cholera typically causes acute watery diarrhoea and can affect people of all ages. The infection can sometimes be severe and life-threatening. Cape Times
