Cape Town – The owner of a starved pony found on school property in Bridgetown, Athlone, is facing a charge of animal cruelty. Last week, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA received a complaint about an emaciated pony on a school property with no access to food or water. It is believed that the pony had wandered on to the grounds, as the animal did not belong to the school. SPCA inspectors found the pony lying on the ground, too weak to get up.  “It was evident to the inspectors that the pony was in need of immediate intervention and our Horse Care Unit was called in to bring a horsebox,” the organisation said. When help arrived, the team had to lift the horse, now named Rainbow Dash, and walk him slowly into the horsebox “It was not an easy task to get him on to his feet. It took four team members to lift Rainbow Dash.” The pony was taken to the Horse Care Unit, where he was examined by the veterinary team and prescribed a special diet for weight gain. “The owner subsequently came forward and opted to surrender Rainbow Dash to the Cape of Good Hope SPCA, admitting that he was not in a position to take care of him properly. The owner will now be facing criminal charges in terms of the Animals Protection Act 71 of 1962 for animal cruelty,” the organisation said.
