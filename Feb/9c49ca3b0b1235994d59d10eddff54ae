The community is angered over this. We appeal to the community to report any firearms in the community, because we believe less firearms means less killings. “The boy’s shooting was a shock to all of us. We believe that police could do more. We have also been requesting a special budget for safety in our community and allocation of resources from the City,” said Mukaddam. Elsies River Community Police Forum, Hamish Arries noted that shootings in the area are usually gang related. “Avonwood is a volatile area, shootings happen during the day and even at night.
