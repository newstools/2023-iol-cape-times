Cape Town - Police have arrested more than 30 illegal immigrants, following reports of conflict among foreign nationals in Grabouw. Police spokesperson Ndakhe Gwala said the Provincial Extortion Task Team in conjunction with the Provincial Economic Infrastructure Task Team and Grabouw police conducted a joint operation on Tuesday which led to the arrest of more than 30 suspects after recent conflict among foreign nationals in the area. “On Tuesday, the group patrolled on foot in Kgotsong informal settlement, Grabouw which resulted in the arrests of the 30 illegal immigrants. “Additionally, the members raided a house during the same operation and recovered a 9mm pistol. They subsequently arrested three foreign nationals, aged between 22 and 30,” Gwala said. In another incident, the officers received a tip-off about a male suspect selling drugs at his residence. “The team, in pursuit of the information they received, found and confiscated 216 stops, 70 bankies and two large bags of dagga,” Gwala said. A 39-year-old man was arrested for dealing in drugs. The suspects are expected to make their court appearances in the Grabouw Magistrate’s Court soon. Earlier this month, police arrested 19 undocumented foreign nationals and handed them over to Immigration officers attached to the Department of Home Affairs after integrated forces conducted foot and vehicle patrols in the Harare and Mazhaza policing precincts.
