Cape Town - Security has been increased at the R500 million Delft Symphony Way housing project after three construction workers were shot at the weekend. The workers came under attack on Saturday. The City of Cape Town said law enforcement agencies were monitoring the situation and that the municipality would not tolerate criminal attacks, community interference or acts of extortion against its projects. A reward of R5 000 is available for information leading to the arrest of the criminals. The incident comes about a week after the Standing Committee on Human Settlements met with stakeholders in the province to report on the extent of the extortion crisis in the housing sector. As per a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA, 2015) between ACSA and the City, the target area for the housing project will be Blikkiesdorp, Malawi Camp and Freedom Farm. Construction of internal civil services commenced in April 2022, and the estimated construction commencement of the top structures will be July 2024 for Site A and November 2024 for Site B, subject to development approvals. Construction of the project is expected to be completed toward the end of 2026 if all goes according to plan. “We are committed to seeing this project to its conclusion in the agreed-to timelines to the benefit of some of our most vulnerable beneficiaries. Project timelines have not been impacted by the recent incident, but it is absolutely critical that members of the community help us to complete this project without further bloodshed,” said mayco member for human settlements Malusi Booi. “Anonymous tip-offs and information leading to the arrest of criminals targeting the project will help to safeguard the project. “The City’s Law enforcement agencies and the South African Police Service have been consulted, and criminal cases opened for investigation in addition to the enhanced on-site security that has been implemented.” Anonymous tip-offs are welcomed.
