Cape Town - City lifeguards under the guidance of a police dive unit have recovered the body of one of two fishermen who disappeared while fishing in Gordon’s Bay. The men, aged 54 and 40, went missing on Monday after fishing off-shore of Die Poort. According to the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), their teams in Gordon’s Bay, Kleinmond, Strandfontein and Simon’s Town were activated after the incident was reported.
