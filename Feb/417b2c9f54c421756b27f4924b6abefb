Cape Town - Authorities have again appealed to the public to avoid the Bos 400 shipwreck at Maori Bay, between Llandudno and Hout Bay, after a 19-year-old was injured at the site last week. NSRI Hout Bay station commander Spencer Oldham said NSRI responded to reports of an injured person at the Bos 400 wreck just before 2pm on Wednesday. NSRI Hout Bay duty crew, who had earlier launched to assist NSRI Kommetjie at a sinking fishing vessel, were activated to assist at the Bos 400 site. “A 19-year-old male was found by NSRI medics to have been recovered onto rocks by friends and he had sustained injuries reportedly in a fall or a dive off the Bos 400 wreck,” Oldham said. The NSRI said it was estimated that at least 30 people were at the Bos 400 on the day. Western Cape Health EMS rescue squad and an EMS ambulance were activated to respond to the NSRI Hout Bay rescue station. The NSRI Hout Bay rescue craft Nadine Gordimer also responded from Hout Bay, accompanied by EMS rescue paramedics. The man was stabilised and secured into a specialised stretcher and floated to an NSRI rescue craft. He was brought to the NSRI Hout Bay rescue station and transported to hospital by EMS ambulance in a stable condition. NSRI chief executive Dr Cleeve Robertson appealed to the public to avoid the Boss 400 wreck. “Most of the wreck lies submerged just below the surface under the crane boom which, added to the considerable height, makes jumping into the water a potential suicide mission. There have already been serious injuries at the site and our greatest concern is that the next jumper may be fatally injured. The wreck should not be boarded and the site is not safe to jump into the water.” Cape Times
