Cape Town - Another two suspects have been arrested after a R3.2 million crayfish tail and abalone bust in Belhar. Police said a 21-year-old suspect was arrested on Saturday after he was found in possession of the seafood without a permit. The City on Monday said its law enforcement officers, attached to the K9 Unit, further arrested two suspects, aged 23 and 26. “The officers attached to the K9 Unit executed a search warrant in Bellville and arrested two suspects for the possession of abalone and crayfish, valued at approximately R3.2m. “Officers found 6 416 units of abalone stored in three big deep freezers inside the garage, four whole crayfish, 40 crayfish tails and approximately R150 000 in cash. The suspects, a 26-year-old male and a 23-year-old female were detained at Bellville SAPS,” the City said. Police said the 21-year-old suspect was expected in court on Monday. “The swift response of the Maitland flying squad ensured the arrest of a 21-year-old male suspect for possession of crayfish without a permit.  “Members followed up on information about crayfish tails at an address in Belhar. They swooped in and searched the premises. (A total of) 3 86 crayfish tails worth R1.7m were found in a fridge. A 21-year-old male was arrested and detained at Belhar SAPS. The suspect will make his court appearance in the Bellville Magistrate’s court on Monday,” police said.
