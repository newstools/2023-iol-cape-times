Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has offered a R5 000 reward for tip offs on housing project attacks that lead to arrests.  This, after housing projects have increasingly come under attack from criminals, extortionists and members of the community, the City said.  “In just one week, at our huge R500-million Delft Symphony Way project, with earmarked beneficiaries of 3 300, contractors were shot and then days later, the site was petrol bombed.  “This is but one project, however, we do not want to place our staff and contractors at added risk by going into too many details.  “Last year we also cancelled two civil contracts worth R140-million at the City’s Beacon Valley project.” The R5 000 reward forms part of a new six-point plan by the City to help protect housing projects. “Currently, 12 City projects remain under threat, impacting some 4 500 housing beneficiaries. Greater action is needed from the authorities but also our communities, as we cannot complete projects without the community standing with us.” The six-point plan includes: 1.     Working closer with the SAPS and calling on the NPA to step up efforts to help bring criminals to book. 2.     R15-million in additional funding to enhance security at the projects and increased monitoring. 3.     More cases being investigated by SAPS across the metro. 4.     Offering a R5 000 reward for information leading to arrests. Members of the community may give anonymous tips and it is vital that communities stand with the City and law enforcement authorities. 5.     Greater City law enforcement resources to help protect projects and teams working on the ground. 6.     Call to action to communities to support the City. Anonymous tip-offs can be reported to 0800 1100 77.  Cape Times
