Cape Town - Stellenbosch University (SU) is mourning the loss of its Council chairperson and passionate Matie alumnus Ainsley Moos. Messages have been pouring in for Moos’ family and the university after his death on Tuesday, following a medical procedure. “The family can confirm that their beloved husband, father, brother, uncle and son, Ainsley Moos died suddenly and unexpectedly on (Tuesday) of complications following an anaesthetic for a minor procedure to his mouth at a day clinic in Stellenbosch,” family spokesperson, Gail Strauss said. Moos was also a member of the executive team of the financial services company African Rainbow Capital. He served on the SU council since 2014 and was, among others, chair of the council’s remuneration committee, a member of the executive committee and the human resources committee. He was elected deputy chairperson in 2018 and started his terms as chair on December 3, 2021. SU’s Rector and Vice-Chancellor Professor Wim de Villiers said Moos’ support to him personally was inspirational. “Not only has the university lost an extremely talented council chairperson, but a valued and loyal friend of the university. This is obviously a huge shock to the university community, and it comes, to say the least, at a time when the university has depended heavily on his management expertise, and proven experience as a communications specialist, but also in terms of his skills as manager of stakeholder relations in the corporate world,” De Villiers said. Deputy Chair of Council Dr Nicky Newton-King said Moos’ humility and calm leadership stood the council in good stead as it dealt with a series of critical challenges in the past year. “The university has been so lucky to have counted Ainsley among its leaders at this crucial time in its history,“ she said.
