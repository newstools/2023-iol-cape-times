Cape Town - As the measles continue to infect people in the country, Western Cape Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo encouraged parents to visit their local clinics and vaccinate their children for free.  The department launched its measles vaccination campaign in Kleinvlei, Kuils River, on February 6, which will run until March 31. The message was clear :“Your child’s health is in your hands. Vaccinate against measles."  So far the number of measles vaccines that have been administered are: The Western Cape’s aim is to have 95% of children under the age of 15 immunised against measles. “To be protected against measles, it is important for parents to take up the offer to vaccinate their children.  “The more children under the age of 15 are vaccinated against measles, the less the risks of both short- and long-term potential complications. “I encourage all parents to learn more about measles and to vaccinate their children as soon as possible. The vaccines are free at our facilities, and they will ensure our children are healthy and thriving,” said Mbombo. A mother from Eerste River, Alyssa Du Preez said: “Today I wanted to make sure that I bring my child to the clinic in Kleinvlei to get the measles vaccine. My child’s health is very important to me” Cape Times
